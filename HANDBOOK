~~~ Developer's Handbook ~~~
* Basic rules
- always discuss your problem with other developers or with maintainer of the appropriate section
- be present on developer's IRC
- try not to break the code in master
- if you do one large thing that surely will break the code, create your own branch
- this Handbook is maintained by xHire - if you want to add or modify something, ask him first!

* Filenames
- keep letters small
- if you need more words in a filename, then use this character for separating them: _

* Identificators
- if you need more words in an identificator, then use this character for separating them: _
- don't use global variables

* Translation strings
- keep them clear and following standard scheme
- if a filename is to be mentioned, don't use any quotes and try to situate it to the end of the string

* Code style
- you can use kr.sh script for basic orientation, but think with your head and correct all bull shits
- at the end of each file leave one empty line

* Writing a module
