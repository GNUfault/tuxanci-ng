## Bulánci
I will not go into much detail about this game as it's not important.

Bulánci is a freeware Windows-only action game made in 2001 by SleepTeam.

## Tuxánci FG
> [!NOTE]
> I cannot find much information about Tuxánci FG

Becuase Bulánci was closed-source and freeware only for Windows, Dušan Ďurech created his own game in 2007 inspired by Bulánci named "Tuxánci".

Tuxánci FG lasted from version 0.05 to 0.18.

## Servers
Tuxánci NG had 4 offical multiplayer servers for each map operated by Radek Pinc.

All of the game servers are offline but the site with information about the servers is still up.

I am guessing the game servers went down around 2019.

## Tuxánci
I do not have info on why they rewrote Tuxánci FG but my best guess is Tuxánci FG's code was messy.
