ABOUT
=====
	Tuxanci is first tux shooter ere while inspired by well-known Czech
	game Bulanci. But it goes its own way now and it is much better.
	
	Game supports 1 player and multiplayer game on one computer and also
	supports gameplay over network (LAN/Internet [IPv4 and IPv6]).
	
	Goal in this game is to shoot enemy penguin before he does so. Penguin
	can shoot only in X and Y axes so no diagonal shooting is available yet.

	Weapon list
	-----------
		Pistol
		~~~~~~
			Basic gun - one shot at the time
		Two Pistols
		~~~~~~~~~~~
			2x Basic gun - two shots at once
		Machine gun
		~~~~~~~~~~
			Few shots per fire, small intervals
		Shot gun
		~~~~~~~~
			5 shots per fire, high dispersion
		Laser
		~~~~~
			Shoots fast and long coherent light
		Mine
		~~~~
			Put them around, step on them *KABOOM*
		Bomb ball
		~~~~~~~~~
			Fires bomb which mirrors any obstacles and explodes only if it
			hits penguin.

	Bonus list
	----------
		Speedy tux: tux move faster
		Infinite ammo: you have really big backpack of ammo (fire at will)
		4way shoot: tux fire on shoot in every direction (cost only 1 ammo)
		Teleport: if somebody shoots at Tux he teleport himself away
		Ghost: Tux can move and shoot through obstacles.
		Note
		~~~~
			Bonuses last only few seconds and if tux take another bonus then
			first one looses its effects.

HOWTO COMPILE
=============
	This howto is written for linux. For other platforms please think about
	rather using binary modules.
	First of all we need some libraries:
		(g)libc, SDL, SDL_image, SDL_ttf, optionally SDL_mixer,
		optionally opengl, gettext, libzip

	And some applications:
		cmake version 2.6.0 and above

	Now we have two options what we can do:
	(all commands are supposed to be written in tuxanci/build directory;
	If such does not exist just create it :])

	NOTE: if you want to see all variable options definable by cmake just
	run ccmake instead of cmake.
	Building Client
	---------------
		$ cmake ..
		$ make
		# make install
	Building Server
	--------------
		$ cmake .. -DBUILD_SERVER=1
		$ make
		# make install
	Removing current install
	-----------------------
		Same for both client and server
		# make uninstall
GAME USAGE
==========
	Starting game is simple tuxanci-VERSION or tuxanci-server-V. based on what we
	compiled (based on presumption user installed into directories where path
	is set).
	
	If you are using bundled binary and tuxanci are reporting "File not found!"
	error, you need to launch it directly from BIN directory 
	(eg.: "$ cd tuxanci/bin && ./tuxanci-VERSION").

	For client we create some configuration files in $HOME. There is created
	".tuxanci" directory and in there are pretty selfexplaining .conf files.

	For server we create directory /etc/tuxanci-server/server.conf where you could
	do some changes for it (again pretty selfexplaining).

	Controls

HAVE PROBLEM/FOUND BUG/ETC...
=============================
	If you found some bug or have feature request please fill it into: 
	http://www.tuxanci.org/buglist (you need account for that).

	You need some help with install/etc... feel free to join us on our irc
	channel which is #tuxanci on server irc.freenode.net.

INFORMATIONS FOR TRANSLATORS
============================
	So you want to help us translating our perfect game :] What should you
	do is question you are asking i guess. It is pretty simple. We are using
	gettext so you only have to download our .pot file from git
	<http://repo.or.cz/w/tuxanci.git?a=blob_plain;f=po/tuxanci.pot;hb=HEAD>
	and translate every line into your desired language. MSGID is orginal
	message and MSGSTR is translated one. When you are done you rename
	tuxanci.pot to langcode.po (cs_CZ.po). For translating is needed only
	some text editor (advanced are kbabel, lokalize...) and some skills
	in your and english language. Final product of your effort mail onto our
	mail (team<-at->tuxanci.org). Ah and before I forget update some
	relevant informations into header of your .po file, examples can be
	found in our git too <http://repo.or.cz/w/tuxanci.git?a=tree;f=po;hb=HEAD>.
