ABOUT
=====
	Tuxanci is first tux shooter ere while inspired by well-known Czech
	game Bulanci. But it goes its own way now and it is much better.
	
	Game supports 1 player and multiplayer game on one computer and also
	supports gameplay over network (LAN/Internet [IPv4 and IPv6]).
	
	Goal in this game is to shoot enemy penguin before he does so. Penguin
	can shoot only in X and Y axes so no diagonal shooting is availible yet.

		Two Pistols

			Shoots fast and long coherent light
		Mine

			Put them around, step on them *KABOOM*
		Bomb ball

			hits penguin.

	Bonus list

		Teleport: if somebody shoots at Tux he teleport himself away
		Ghost: Tux can move and shoot through obstracles
		Note

			Bonuses last only few seconds and if tux take another bonus
			first loses its effects.

HOWTO COMPILE
=============
	This howto is written for linux. For other platforms please think about
	rather using binary modules.
	First of all we need some libraries:
		(g)libc, SDL, SDL_image, SDL_ttf, optionally SDL_mixer,
		gettext, libzzip

	And some applications:
		cmake version 2.6.0 and above

	Now we have two options what we can do:
	(all commands are supposed to be written in tuxanci sources directory)
	Building Client
	---------------
		$ cmake .
		$ make
		# make install
	Building Server
	--------------
		$ cmake . -DServer=1
		$ make
		# make install
	Removing current install
	-----------------------
		Same for both client and server
		# make uninstall
	Notes
	-----
		Compilation on windows is little bit tricky. You need MinGW
		<http://www.mingw.org/> and CMake <http://www.cmake.org/>. Then follow
		those steps above. Only add cmake option -G "MinGW Makefiles". If cmd
		say that no make.exe command found you need to use absolute path. Do
		not specify PREFIX!! There is also known bug when in path to game dir
		is space separator -> Compilation will die with error file not found,
		you have to place source to some directory with no space in its path.

		# ADDITIONAL OPTIONS FOR CMAKE
		#option(WITH_SERVER      "Build the server instead of client"        ON)
		#option(WITH_AUDIO       "Build with audio enabled"                  ON)
		#option(ENABLE_DEBUG     "Build debug features"                      OFF)
		#option(WITH_NLS         "Build the translations"                    ON)
		#option(Apple            "Build some apple quirks. USE ONLY ON MAC!" OFF)
		#option(WITH_OPENGL      "Use opengl as renderer instead of SW"      ON)
		#option(BUNDLE           "Use for generating binary. DEV ONLY"       OFF)

GAME USAGE
==========
	Starting game is simple tuxanci-VERSION or tuxanci-server-V. based on what we
	compiled (based on presumption user installed into directories where path
	is set).
	
	If you are using bundled binary and tuxanci are reporting "File not found!"
	error, you need to launch it directly from BIN directory 
	(eg.: "$ cd tuxanci/bin && ./tuxanci-VERSION").

	For client we create some configuration files in $HOME. There is created
	".tuxanci" directory and in there are pretty selfexplaining .conf files.

	For server we create directory /etc/tuxanci-server/server.conf where you could
	do some changes for it (again pretty selfexplaining).

			Save game: F2

HAVE PROBLEM/FOUND BUG/ETC...
=============================
	If you found some bug or have feature request please fill it into: 
	http://www.tuxanci.org/buglist (you need account for that).

	You need some help with install/etc... feel free to join us on our irc
	channel which is #tuxanci on server irc.tuxportal.cz. If you don't like
	irc you can can contact us on our forum also: http://czf.tuxanci.org.

INFORMATIONS FOR TRANSLATORS
============================
	So you want to help us translating our perfect game :] What should you
	do is question you are asking i guess. It is pretty simple. We are using
	gettext so you only have to download our .pot file from git
	<http://repo.or.cz/w/tuxanci.git?a=blob_plain;f=po/tuxanci.pot;hb=HEAD>
	and translate every line into your desired language. MSGID is orginal
	message and MSGSTR is translated one. When you are done you rename
	tuxanci.pot to langcode.po (cs_CZ.po). For translating is needed only
	some text editor (advanced are kbabel, lokalize...) and some skills
	in your and english language. Final product of your effort mail onto our
	mail (team<-at->tuxanci.org). Ah and before I forget update some
	relevant informations into header of your .po file, examples can be
	found in our git too <http://repo.or.cz/w/tuxanci.git?a=tree;f=po;hb=HEAD>.
