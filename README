HOWTO COMPILE
=============
	This howto is written for linux. For other platforms please think about
	rather using binary modules.
	First of all we need some libraries:
		(g)libc, SDL, SDL_image, SDL_ttf, optionally SDL_mixer

	And some applications:
		cmake version 2.4.8 and above

	Now we have two options what we can do:
	(all commands are supposed to be written in tuxanci sources directory)
	Building Client
	---------------
		$ cmake . -DNO_Audio=1	
		$ make
		# make install
	Building Server
	--------------
		$ cmake . -DServer=1
		$ make
		$ make install
	Removing current install
	-----------------------
		Same for both client and server
		# make uninstall
	Notes
	-----
		Compilation on windows is little bit tricky. You need MinGW
		<http://www.mingw.org/> and CMake <http://www.cmake.org/>. Then follow
		those steps above. Only add cmake option -G "MinGW Makefiles". If cmd
		say that no make.exe command found you need to use absolute path. Do
		not specify PREFIX!! There is also known bug when in path to game dir
		is space separator -> Compilation will die with error file not found,
		you have to place source to some directory with no space in its path.
		
		Option -DNO_AUDIO=1 says we want no audio support for client so change
		if you want so.
		
		Server and client can be both on same computer they use different
		folders.
		
		Cleaning data from previous compilation "$ make clean".

		On Apple use please -DApple=1 variable for cmake.
		
		If you want another prefix than /usr/local/, you can achieve this by
		adding -DPREFIX=\\\"/usr/games/\\\" and 
		-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr/games.	Change /usr/games/ to path you
		intend to use.

GAME USAGE
==========
	Starting game is simple tuxanci-ng or tuxanci-ng-server based on what we
	compiled (based on presumption user installed into directories where path
	is set).

	For client we create some configuration files in $HOME. There is created
	".tuxanci-ng" directory and in there are pretty explaining .conf files.

	For server we create directory /etc/tuxanci_ng/server.conf where you could
	do some changes for it (again pretty selfexplaining).

	Controls
	--------

			fire: zero or rctrl
			change weapon: one or rshift
		Player two

			fire: Q
			change weapon: tab
		Common
