HOWTO COMPILE
=============
	This howto is written for linux. For other platforms please think about
	rather using binary modules.
	First of all we need some libraries:
		(g)libc, SDL, SDL_image, SDL_ttf, optionally SDL_mixer

	And some applications:
		cmake version 2.4.6 and above

	Now we have two options what we can do:
	(all commands are supposed to be written in tuxanci sources directory)
	Building Client
	---------------
		$ cmake .
		$ make
		# make install
	Building Server
	--------------
		$ cmake .
		$ make
		# make install
	Removing current install
	-----------------------
		Same for both client and server
		# make uninstall
	Notes
	-----
		Compilation on windows is little bit tricky. You need MinGW
		<http://www.mingw.org/> and CMake <http://www.cmake.org/>. Then follow
		those steps above. Only add cmake option -G "MinGW Makefiles". If cmd
		say that no make.exe command found you need to use absolute path. Do
		not specify PREFIX!! There is also known bug when in path to game dir
		is space separator -> Compilation will die with error file not found,
		you have to place source to some directory with no space in its path.

		# ADDITIONAL OPTIONS FOR CMAKE
		# -DServer=1			# build server
		# -DNO_Audio=1 			# disable audio
		# -DDebug=1			# enable debug
		# -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=-Wall		# modification for CFLAGS
		# -DWin=1			# build windows port
		# -DNLS=1			# enable Gettext NLS
		# -DApple=1			# build apple port
		# -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/bla/	# install prefix
		# -DCMAKE_DATA_PATH=/other/bla/	# install path for data
		# -DCMAKE_CONF_PATH=/etc	# install path for data
		# -DLIB_INSTALL_DIR=/other/bla	# install path for data


GAME USAGE
==========
	Starting game is simple tuxanci or tuxanci-server based on what we
	compiled (based on presumption user installed into directories where path
	is set).
	
	If we are using bundled binary and tuxanci are reporting "File not found!"
	error, you need to launch it directly from BIN directory 
	(eg.: "$ cd tuxanci/bin && ./tuxanci").

	For client we create some configuration files in $HOME. There is created
	".tuxanci" directory and in there are pretty selfexplaining .conf files.

	For server we create directory /etc/tuxanci/server.conf where you could
	do some changes for it (again pretty selfexplaining).

	Controls
	--------

			fire: zero [ 0 ] NumPad
			change weapon: one [ 1 ] NumPad
		Player two

			fire: Q
			change weapon: tab
		Common
